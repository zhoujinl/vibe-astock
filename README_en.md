## What it is

**It finishes today's review for you.**

A short-term daily review means going through the limit-up pool, the consecutive-board ladder,
the Dragon-Tiger list, sector money flow and theme attribution — and then working out whether
yesterday's limit-up stocks made money today. That's an hour of the same work every day.
Vibe-Astock automates it: pull the data → five analysts each cover one aspect of the market →
converge into one market read you can actually sit down with.

A daily review is **factual work** (getting straight what happened today), so it never needed
recommendations in the first place. That is why nine tenths of the screen is the **hard-metric layer** —
money effect / promotion rate / ladder structure / sentiment cycle / loss effect / seal quality /
theme event tree / historical percentile (all defined in the glossary below). **Every one of those is
pure computation straight from the data source; no AI touches them, and they are on screen the
moment the page loads.** The AI's job is to turn seven or eight data
sources into one readable story, not to pick stocks.

**What it does not do:** no stock recommendations, no "should you join in", no entry or exit levels.
Individual stocks are only ever stated as facts (which theme it belongs to, how many consecutive
boards, which brokerage desks showed up on the Dragon-Tiger list, where it sits on the chart). Directional and
sentiment calls stop at the sector level.

### A quick glossary

A-share short-term trading has its own vocabulary and most of it has no English equivalent,
so here is the whole set up front. Chinese terms are given so you can match them to the UI.

| Term used here | 中文 | What it means |
|---|---|---|
| **limit up** | 涨停 | The daily upper price limit (+10% on the main boards, +20% on ChiNext/STAR, +5% for ST names). A stock that closes there is "at limit up" |
| **sealed** | 封板 | Buy orders are stacked at the limit and the price stays locked there. "Sealed at 09:31" = locked from 09:31 on |
| **broken board** | 炸板 | It was sealed at the limit during the day, then the seal broke and it traded below |
| **board / N boards** | 板 / N连板 | One "board" = one limit-up close. "3 boards" = three consecutive limit-up closes. A "first board" is day one of a streak |
| **promotion** | 晋级 | A stock on an N-board streak hits limit up again the next day, so it moves to N+1. The **promotion rate** is what share of a tier managed that. Again a literal translation — read it as "continuation rate" |
| **money effect** | 赚钱效应 | How yesterday's limit-up stocks did today. There is no standard English name for it — this is the Chinese term translated literally. It is the single best read on whether chasing strength is currently paying |
| **loss effect** | 亏钱效应 | The same batch, measured by damage: how many fell more than 5% / 7%, how many hit limit down |
| **leader** | 龙头 | In this dashboard: the stock with the highest board count that day (ties are broken by source order, not by judgement). Traders use 龙头 more loosely than that. Shown as a sentiment gauge, not a buy list |
| **settled record** | 定稿记录 | End-of-day data for a session that has already closed, cached to disk. Facts that will not change again, so past sessions never depend on live quotes |

## Screenshots

**Review dashboard** — the hard-metric layer, there the moment you open it. Market breadth as the
denominator, where yesterday's strong names landed today, money effect and loss effect side by side.

<img src="assets/screenshots/01-review-metrics.png" alt="Review dashboard: market breadth, yesterday's strong-stock feedback, money effect, loss effect">

**Tomorrow's verification conditions** — turns tonight's read into something you can actually check
tomorrow: every line carries today's baseline and the threshold a move has to clear to count.

<img src="assets/screenshots/02-verification.png" alt="Tomorrow's verification conditions, each with today's baseline and its threshold">

**Market data** — indices, overnight markets (including the Magnificent Seven), sector money flow,
turnover ranking, and today's live limit-up sentiment. Auto-refresh optional.

<img src="assets/screenshots/03-market-data.png" alt="Market data: indices and overnight markets">

**5-day heat + leader lineage** — how sentiment moved over five sessions, and how far the leaders
from a few days ago have fallen since.

## What's in this version

**v0.1.1** — five entries in the sidebar:

| Entry | What it is |
|---|---|
| **Review dashboard** | The main page and the default landing page. AI narrative on top, hard metrics below |
| Market data | Indices / sector money flow / money rotation / active stocks |
| First-board analysis | Today's first-board names — when each one first sealed, and how many times the seal broke |
| 5-day heat | How theme heat moved over the last 5 trading days |
| Connect AI | Set an API key or point it at a local CLI (see below) |

## The core: derived sentiment metrics

The number of limit-ups is only raw material. What actually tells you the state of the market is
this handful of **derived** readings:

| Metric | What it is | Why it matters |
|---|---|---|
| **Money effect** | Yesterday's limit-up stocks today: mean / **median** / share that closed up / share that hit limit up again | 40 limit-ups but yesterday's batch is at a median of −1.8% today is an ebbing market; 25 limit-ups with a median of +4% is a healthy one |
| **Promotion rate** | Share of each board tier that hit limit up again today (1→2 / 2→3 / 3+) | **1→2 is the most sensitive**: a clear drop means the tide is going out, a rebound means sentiment is recovering |
| **Consecutive-board premium** | How yesterday's 2-board-and-above names did today | Whether buyers are still stepping in for the high-streak names, or leaving them to fall |
| **Ladder structure** | Count at each board tier + gap detection | 5-board and 2-board names but nothing at 3–4 leaves the top name isolated: when its streak ends there is no tier just below it ready to become the new leader |
| **Sentiment cycle** | A sentiment score over the last 10 trading days, locating where this round started and what day we are on | So you know where in the cycle you are standing |

> ⚠️ **The mean and the median often disagree** — a few big gainers pull the mean up.
> For "what most people are feeling", go by the median.

## Architecture

```
limit-up pool / Dragon-Tiger / sector money flow / theme attribution / Tencent quotes
        ↓
derived sentiment metrics + objective fact tables
        (pure computation, no AI — nine tenths of the screen)
        ↓
five short-term analysts
        (sentiment · money flow · themes · Dragon-Tiger desks · leader tracking)
        ↓
review judge → structured market read
        (sentiment phase / active directions + evidence + what would falsify them / risk notes)
```

## Custom analysis style (prompt packs)

The engine — data pipeline, multi-agent orchestration, reflection loop — is generic; **what gets
said, and how far it goes**, is decided by the prompt pack. Everyone's short-term framework is
different: some watch the sentiment cycle, some only trade first boards, some just follow the money.
So this layer is replaceable.

The repo ships with `RESEARCH_PACK` (observation and analysis at the market and sector level).
To swap in your own:

The easiest option is to change only the wording and keep the built-in output schema.
You can copy this and run it as is:

```python
# ~/.vibe-astock/prompts_local.py
from duanxian.prompts import PromptPack, RESEARCH_PACK

PACK = PromptPack(
    name="my-style",
    analyst_style="只讲情绪周期位置和晋级率，别的少说。",   # tone and scope for the five analysts
    analyst_len="控制在 250 字内。",
    judge_requirements="""1. 判断当前市场情绪档位（冰点/修复/发酵/亢奋/退潮）。
2. 说清这个档位的依据是哪几个读数。
3. 列出需警惕的风险信号。""",                              # what the judge must produce
    # These three go together — either use all the built-ins, or write a full set of your own
    focus_model=RESEARCH_PACK.focus_model,      # = schemas.TomorrowFocus
    focus_skeleton=RESEARCH_PACK.focus_skeleton,
    render_focus=RESEARCH_PACK.render_focus,
)
```

To replace the shape of the conclusion as well, define your own `focus_model` (a pydantic model),
`focus_skeleton` (the English-key skeleton handed to JSON mode) and `render_focus`
(model → markdown). Those three must match each other. The full field list is `PromptPack`
in `duanxian/prompts.py`; `TomorrowFocus` in `duanxian/schemas.py` is a working example to copy.

The engine finds that file on its own (or point `VIBE_ASTOCK_PROMPTS` at any path). If it fails to
load, the engine prints why and falls back to the default pack. The file lives outside this repo and
is not distributed with the code; what you write in it, how you use it, and the consequences are
yours — please also confirm what your own jurisdiction requires for this kind of activity.

---

## Quick start

```bash
# Python >= 3.10 (required by recent akshare)
python3.12 -m venv .venv && .venv/bin/pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Build the frontend first (build output is not in git; the backend serves it directly):

```bash
cd frontend && npm install && npm run build
```

Configure the LLM — **two backends, use whichever you have**:

**① You have an OpenAI-compatible API key** (the default; the example here is MiMo):

```bash
# ~/.config/mimo/mimo.env
MIMO_API_KEY=...
MIMO_BASE_URL=https://token-plan-cn.xiaomimimo.com/v1
MIMO_MODEL=mimo-v2.5-pro
```

**② You only have a Codex / Claude subscription and no API key**: use the CLI you are already
logged into on this machine. No key needed.

```bash
# Codex CLI / skill is the default review backend, running under workspace-write sandbox.
# To force it explicitly: VIBE_LLM_CLI=codex .venv/bin/python server.py
```

> ⚠️ Codex is now allowed by default. To also open auto-approving CLIs such as qwen / deepseek,
> you still have to set `VIBE_ALLOW_UNSAFE_CLI=<the same one>` explicitly. Not opening those
> automatically is deliberate: it would also open up "ask the AI" in the browser, and that path
> puts fetched news text straight into the prompt, which is a far larger injection surface than
> the review itself. The `codex` branch now runs review prompts under `workspace-write`; `claude`
> no longer auto-routes. Running the review on its own with `python main.py` does not need the second switch.

Run it:

```bash
.venv/bin/python server.py          # one process, one port :8910, all five entries
```
```bash
.venv/bin/python main.py            # or run today's review straight from the CLI
```

⚠️ **A review can only ever be run on a session that has already closed.** With no date given it
picks the most recent closed trading day; give it a day that has not closed yet and it will refuse,
and tell you to use that most recent closed day instead (the limit-up pool and the Dragon-Tiger list are not final
intraday, and feeding them in only makes the AI improvise). If that session has already been run,
you just read it — it is not re-run; add `?force=1` if you want it re-run.

**Past sessions are always readable**: money effect / loss effect / consecutive-board premium /
yesterday's strong-stock feedback all prefer the **settled record** — end-of-day data cached to disk once a session has closed,
falling back to Eastmoney's previous-day limit-up pool — rather than live quotes — so you can pull
up last Wednesday's review in the middle of a trading session.

Data lives in `~/.duanxian-agents/` (reviews / heat / cache); the market-data tabs use `~/.vibe-research/`.

### Environment variables

| Variable | Default | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| `VIBE_PORT` | `8910` | Backend port |
| `VIBE_LLM_CLI` | unset | Use a local CLI as the LLM (`codex` / `claude` …); set this and you need no API key |
| `VIBE_ALLOW_UNSAFE_CLI` | unset | Allow auto-approving CLIs, comma-separated; `codex` is already allowed by default (see the note above) |
| `VIBE_ASTOCK_PROMPTS` | `~/.vibe-astock/prompts_local.py` | Swap in another analysis style (see "Custom analysis style") |
| `VIBE_ALLOW_HOSTS` | unset | Add your domain here when serving under one, otherwise write requests get a 403 |
| `VIBE_MARKET_PROXY` | unset | Set to `1` when Eastmoney is reachable **only** through your proxy. Same as `VR_DATA_PROXY=1`; either works |
| `VIBE_MARKET_DIRECT` | unset | The other direction: set to `1` to force a direct connection when your proxy breaks Eastmoney and even the limit-up pool fails. ⚠️ This is **process-wide** and also turns off the proxy fallback for Eastmoney requests |
| `VR_API_KEY` | unset | Put a key check in front of the market-data endpoints |

## Data sources

| Source | What it provides | Key needed? |
|---|---|---|
| akshare (Eastmoney limit-up pool / Dragon-Tiger) | limit-ups · broken boards · limit-downs · board ladder · Dragon-Tiger desks | No |
| Eastmoney `push2delay` clist | sector / single-stock money flow, turnover ranking | No |
| akshare previous-day limit-up pool | **The settled record**: how yesterday's limit-ups did on the target day (the main source for money effect / loss effect / board premium / the feedback matrix) | No |
| Tencent Finance `qt.gtimg.cn` | batched live quotes (watchlist, today's live limit-up sentiment; also the fallback for the items above) | No |
| Tencent hist `stock_zh_a_hist_tx` | candles and the trading calendar (Eastmoney `push2his` is blocked on some networks, hence Tencent) | No |
| Tonghuashun iWenCai | limit-up reason themes (→ theme event tree) | **Yes** |

**Every source above is free and connects directly; the theme strings are the only one that needs a key.** The theme strings
come from Tonghuashun iWenCai and need `IWENCAI_API_KEY`; without it the app still runs, the
"theme event tree" block just says it is unavailable (the rest of the review is unaffected).
To set it, create a `.env` in the repo root with one line:

```
IWENCAI_API_KEY=your-key
```

Limit-up pool summaries for past trading days are cached to disk (`~/.duanxian-agents/cache/`) —
they are facts that will never change again, so from the second time on they cost almost nothing.

## Tests

```bash
.venv/bin/python -m pytest -q
```

341 cases, covering metric calculation, boundary conditions and degradation paths — with the weight
on the places where **being wrong looks exactly like being right**: the page renders as usual, the
numbers look plausible, and the conclusion is false.
